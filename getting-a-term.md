# Getting a term.

Terms are used to group various entities in WordPress, typically posts. Terms are members of a taxonomy. Post tags and categories are arguably the most common taxonomies in WordPress.  If you were to create a category, you are creating a term. If you create a tag, you are creating a term. Posts, pages, and many other entities can the be associated with a term.  If we are running a barbecue blog, we might have a bunch of categories: Memphis, Texas, Carolina, Kansas City.  Depending on the post or article we will group with the respective terms.
